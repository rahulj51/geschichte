Geschichte (German for "history") is a fast, keyboard-driven terminal UI for exploring git file history. Navigate through commits, view diffs, and understand how your files evolved over time—all without leaving your terminal.

Unlike full-featured git clients, Geschichte focuses specifically on **single-file history exploration**. It's designed for developers who want to quickly understand how a particular file changed over time, not for managing branches, commits, or other git operations. Think of it as a specialized tool that does one thing exceptionally well: showing you the story of your file.

I wrote this because I was badly missing this feature in 'Zed', my primary IDE. Geschichte can be opened in a terminal window in your favorite IDE.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Interactive file picker** - Fuzzy search and select any tracked file with popup interface
- **File history visualization** with commit dates, hashes, authors, and subjects
- **Working directory support** - See uncommitted changes as the top entry
- **Interactive navigation** with vim-style keybindings and focus-aware panels
- **Colorized diffs** with visual highlighting for additions, deletions, and context
- **Commit-to-commit diff** - Select any two commits to see changes between them
- **Rename tracking** - Follow files across renames and moves (with `--follow`)
- **Performance optimized** with LRU caching for instant diff switching
- **Split-pane interface** with resizable panels and help overlay

### User Experience
- **Seamless file switching** - Switch between files without losing context using 'f' key
- **Mac-friendly navigation** - Multiple scroll options (PageUp/Down, Ctrl+D/U, Ctrl+F/B)
- **Mouse support** - Scrolling support with mouse
- **Focus-aware controls** - Arrow keys work differently based on active panel
- **Comprehensive keybindings** - Vim, emacs, and traditional navigation styles

## Commit-to-Commit Diff

Geschichte allows you to compare any two commits to see exactly what changed between them. This is perfect for understanding the evolution of your code across multiple commits.

### How to Use Range Diff

1. **Mark First Commit**: Navigate to any commit and press `d` - you'll see a green `► ` marker
2. **Select Second Commit**: Navigate to another commit and press `d` again
3. **View Diff**: The diff panel automatically updates to show changes between the two commits
4. **Clear Selection**: Press `Esc` to clear the selection and return to normal mode

### Visual Indicators

- **Green `► ` arrow**: Shows which commit is marked for comparison  
- **Header format**: `Diff (older..newer)` shows the range being compared
- **Selection mode**: `Diff (abc123) [Selecting...]` when first commit is marked
- **Chronological order**: Always shows older→newer regardless of selection order

### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Navigate to an older commit (bottom of history)
# 2. Press 'd' → see green arrow marker
# 3. Navigate to newer commit (top of history)  
# 4. Press 'd' → see diff between the commits
# 5. Green lines show code added in newer commit
# 6. Red lines show code removed from older commit
```

The range diff works across any two commits - compare your working directory with any historical commit, or see what changed between two releases!

### Coming Soon
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Search in diff |
| `c` | Copy commit hash |
| `m` | Cycle merge parents |
